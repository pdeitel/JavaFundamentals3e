Chapter 19 on building Java API-based genAI apps was completely rewritten since our corresponding books

* Java How to Program, 12/e https://deitel.com/jhtp12
* Java for Programmers, 5/e https://deitel.com/javafp5

were published. Wee now use OpenAI's official openai-java library (https://github.com/openai/openai-java), which did not exist when we initially developed Chapter 19 of the books.
